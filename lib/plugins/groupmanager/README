GROUPMANAGER
========

GROUPMANAGER is based on the original plugin GROUPMGR by Alex Forencich. This plugin has
not been updated since 2010. It actually even never left the devel-zone, but the idea is
great!

GROUPMGR already allowed easy modification of group membership by non-admins.
This greatly simplified management of collaborative projects by group-admins.

GROUPMANAGER adds in functionality from the usermanager by Christopher Smith. This way
existing users can easily be found and added to groups in Wikis with many users.
Groupmanager may also enable group-admins to add and delete users independently from a
super user, if these users belong to the groups they administer.

GROUPMANAGER has been designed with a certain scenario and setup in mind.
This scenario is helpful to make Groupmanager a workable solution.
That's why it is worked out at https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:groupmanager in more detail.

Installation
------------

Unzip into lib/plugins directory

=====Syntax=====

<code>~~groupmanager|[groups to manage]|[allowed users and groups]~~</code>

Groups to manage separated by commas; the first group in the list will be the default group.

**Be careful**:
Use ''~~groupmanager~~'' in lowercase letters; ''~~GROUPMANAGER~~'' may not work!

==== Example 1 ====

<code>~~groupmanager|wg_mygroup_reader|@wg_mygroup_admin~~</code>

Members of group ‘ wg_mygroup_reader ‘ can be managed by group ‘ wg_mygroup_admin ‘

==== Example 2 ====

<code>~~groupmanager|wg_mygroup_reader, wg_mygroup_editor|harald, @admin~~</code>

Members of ‘ wg_mygroup_reader ‘ and ‘ wg_mygroup_editor ‘ can be managed by user ‘harald’ and members of the group ‘admin’


REMARKS
-------
1.	In the examples above groups managed by groupmanager are named following the naming 
	convention “wg_[groupname]_[role]”. This is not required by the syntax, but I would
	advise it nevertheless. (Side note: The interface beautifies the name of groups for
	simple users a bit by deleting the prefix “wg_”, replacing “_” with ” ” and
	capitalizing the first letter of the resulting words.)
2.	Super user groups can only be managed by super users
3.	Group-admins may assign the group-admin role to other users!
4.	But: users cannot remove themselves from the group that grants them access to the
	group admin (including admins)
5.	The conf_namespace option specifies a separate namespace for configuration.
	When the config namespace is used, a placeholder tag (~~groupmanager~~) can be used
	in the actual page while the full tag is placed in the configuration namespace at
	config_namespace:ID. 
6.	If require_conf_namespace is set, all configuration options placed in the page
	are ignored, necessitating the use of the configuration namespace. For security
	reasons, this is the default configuration.
7.	The “forbidden_groups” configuration setting specifies groups that cannot be
	edited with the plugin (only relevant if conf_namespace is not configured).
8.	If allow_add_user is set, a dialog will be present in the interface that will
	allow users to be added to the Wiki. They will be automatically added to the
	“default” group, which is the first managed group (wg_mygroup_reader in the example).
9.	If allow_delete_user is set, checkboxes will be added to each user-record.
	Clicking on “update group” will delete checked users.
